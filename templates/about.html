<h1 class="text-center"> Our Misson Statement </h1>
Budget Report Card is an app/website that shows you how much money you’ve been using in different places and how you could use it in better ways to create more profit for you. Our application takes what you pay for that you need, stuff you pay for that is flexible, and extra money that goes towards your savings. Our goal is for you to make more money and save more money and we’ll show you different ways on how you could do that depending on your spending. In order for us to do this we plug in your weekly or bi weekly payroll into an equation that divides your fixed income by 50%, your flexible income by 30%, and your savings by 20%.
